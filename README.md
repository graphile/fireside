# Graphile fireside chats
Graphile fireside chats for maintainers and contributors to the Graphile suite.

### What?

A fireside chat is a personal and interactive discussion in a safe and cosy setting. A Graphile fireside chat takes place either on Zoom or in a Discord voice channel between project maintainers and contributors. Participants are either sponsors or project contributors and many are personally invited. Discussion points can be proposed and agreed beforehand. 

### Goals

Our hope is to bring together small focused groups of contributors in a welcoming environment to discuss the direction, issues, and gaps in the available knowledge base of our projects and to empower them to get more involved.

### Code of Conduct

Like all Graphile projects and community spaces, we run fireside chats under the [Contributor Covenant code of conduct](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/code-of-conduct/). 
Code of conduct contact is @Benjie, @JemGillam or email team AT graphile dot com.
