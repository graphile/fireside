# Graphile fireside chats
Graphile fireside chats for maintainers and contributors to the Graphile suite.

### What?

A fireside chat is a personal and interactive discussion in a safe and cosy setting. A Graphile fireside chat takes place either on Zoom or in a Discord voice channel between project maintainers and contributors. Participants are personally invited and discussion points are agreed beforehand. 

### Goals

Our hope is to foster a warm and welcoming atomsphere where any participant can explore any relevant topic with questions and discussions, leading to a greater sense of community ownership over the running of and direction of our various open source projects. 

### Code of Conduct

Like all Graphile projects and community spaces, we run fireside chats under the [Contributor Covenant code of conduct](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/code-of-conduct/). 
Code of conduct contact is @Benjie, @JemGillam or email team AT graphile dot com.
