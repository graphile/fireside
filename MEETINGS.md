# Graphile fireside chats

Graphile aims to host fireside chats for the Crystal repo projects (PostGraphile,
Grafast, etc) on the second Thursday of the month and Worker on the fourth
Thursday of alternate months at 15:00 UTC to discuss the direction, issues,
and gaps in the available knowledge base of our projects. Initially our aim
is to to empower contributors to get more involved.

Attendance to fireside chats is open to all sponsors and those who have been
invited, but all attendees must agree to the rules outlined in [AGREEMENT.md](./AGREEMENT.md).

To attend a chat, please add yourself to the relevant project file in the
[agendas folder](./agendas/).

If you would like to attend but the time is not convenient for you,
please file an issue to let us know; we'd like to enable as many potential
contributors as possible to attend.
